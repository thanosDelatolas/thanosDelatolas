Hello 🍫 !

My name is Thanos Delatolas and I am a final year PhD student at Technical University of Denmark, expected to graduate in September 2025. I have worked with video segmentation, multi-modal diffusion models and large language models.

🎯 As my next step, I’d love to work in industry to create products leveraging recent advances in Machine Learning.
